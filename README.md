# Emotica-Video-Suggestion

The human face plays a prodigious role for automatic recognition of emotions in
the fields of identification of human emotions. Emotions are reflected from
speech, hand &gestures of the body through facial expressions. Here extracting
and understanding of human emotions has a highly importance of the interaction
between human and machine communication. In this paper, we present a potential
approach to detect human emotion in real time. This system simultaneously
detected the face emotions from camera. For any face detected in camera, we
extract the corresponding facial landmarks and examine different kinds of
features and models for predicting human emotions.
